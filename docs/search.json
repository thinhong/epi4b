These assumptions must be valid for the model to be accurate.\nHow do we know if an assumption holds true? Assumptions act as our hypotheses, which we can test by analysing the data. This book guides you through the methods and visualisations to validate assumptions in epidemiological models.\n\n\n\n\nVynnycky, E., & White, R. (2010).
